    <h1>1 · Master</h1>
    <p>Li Huowang raised the pestle in his hand, tediously smashing it again and again into the medicine jar, grinding the smooth green stones mixed with silt within into a powder.</p><br>
    <p>Although the cave was freezing and damp, and the youth wore only a coarse cloth shirt, his face showed no sign of discomfort, as if he was completely unconcerned.</p><br>
    <p>He was not the only one in the cave. There were other men and women with ages similar to his, with the same bundled hair, the same coarse clothes and hemp rope.</p><br>
    <p>The difference between them and Li Huowang was that they had all had obvious deformities, such as albinism and poliomyelitis.</p><br>
    <p>All kinds of congenital and acquired defects could be found. The small storage cave seemed like some sort of museum of deformities.</p><br>
    <p>These people had the same jobs as Li Huowang, although the materials they pounded were different. Some people pounded gold stones, while others crushed medicine, but it could be clearly seen that nobody was at ease.</p><br>
    <p> "Ah!"</p>
    <p> A woman's terrified scream attracted everyone's attention.</p><br>
    <p>In the edge of the cave, a fat youth with a harelip revealed a disgusting smile, attempting to pull a young albino girl into his embrace.</p><br>
    <p> "Just a moment, I promise, heheheh~"<sup><a id="ref-1" href="#note-1">[1]</a></sup></p><br>
    <p>Li Huowang ignored the noise, closing his eyes and went back to his job.</p><br>
    <p>Hearing the woman's cries becoming more and more miserable, Li Huowang cursed in irritation and stood up holding the stone jar in one hand.</p><br>
    <p>A muffled thunk was heard as stone and bone collided.</p><br>
    <p>The fat youth with the split lip sat dazedly on the floor with blood flowing out of his head, staring. After two seconds, his expression twisted with pain as he hugged his wound and started howling.</p><br>
    <p>The white-haired, white-skinned girl covered her shirt and fearfully hid behind Li Huowang, escaping the fate of being defiled.</p><br>
    <p> "I'm telling you! You're finished! You know my Master? When that old man finds out, he'll kill you!"</p>
    <p> The fat man with the spit lip threatened with a face full of fury.</p><br>
    <p> "What the hell is he? Less than a fart!"</p>
    <p> As Li Huowang said these words, the entire room was shocked, fallling into silence.</p><br>
    <p>The others in the room never thought that the man in front of them dared to say such words.</p><br>
    <p>Looking at the expressions of the seniors and juniors in front of him, Li Huowang took a deep breath, supressing the rage within his heart.</p><br>
    <p> "What happenned to me, getting so angry at these sorts of things? I've clearly never had a righteous character. I can't let them affect me, calm down, calm down."</p><br>
    <p>Just as Li Huowang as attempting to calm down, he heard someone calling for him at the door.</p><br>
    <p> "Junior brother Li, junior sister Wang, Master is calling you over."</p>
    <p> The tall youth who spoke was clearly of a different status than Li Huowang, clad in a green daoist robe.</p><br>
    <p>Although the daoist robe appeared old, its sleeve cuffs washed so many times it lost color, it was still many times better than the hemp clothes Li Huowang wore.</p><br>
    <p>He bore a horsetail whisk in one hand, gazing arrogantly at the juniors before him.</p><br>
    <p>Seeing the young Daoist priest appear, the fatass with the injured head wore a smile full of schadenfreude.</p>
    <p> "Haha! You're done for! It's your turn today!"</p><br>
    <p>But Li Huowang completely ignored him, turning to follow a woman who had a crooked mouth with saliva trickling out. The woman's face was a waxy white, and she seemed very sickly.</p><br>
    <p>Just as he began walking, he felt someone tugging at his sleeve, not letting him leave. Li Huowang turned his head to see the albino girl whom he had just rescued.</p><br>
    <p>With tears in her eyes, she incessantly shook her head, her eyes full of terror.</p><br>
    <p>Li Huowang coldy tugged his sleeve back, walking forwards with large strides.</p><br>
    <p>Outside of the materials room was a large cave, its walls full of similar openings. They all appeared crude, their creator obviously not very skilled.</p><br>
    <p>The entire cave was very large, with large and small paths going in all directions, like an enlarged anthill.</p><br>
    <p>A rotting peice of peach wood was nailed on top of every cave segment, with the names of each cave carved into them - Spirit Palace, Old Discipline Hall, Worshipping Ancestors Palace, and Four Imperial Hall.</p><br>
    <p>A natural cave had been decorated to look like a dojo.</p><br>
    <p>As the two people continued walking along the cave, the woman with the crooked out took out a black object from a pocket, suddenly presenting it to Li Huowang, saying in a foolish voice:</p>
    <p> "Eat... thin candy?"</p><br>
    <p>With a slight frown on his face, Li Huowang, knowing the other party was a fool, immediately took it and stuffed it into his sleeve.</p><br>
    <p>Seeing Li Huowang take it, she took out another peice to stuff into her mouth, continuing to talk like and idiot:</p>
    <p> "Master good... has candy..."</p><br>
    <p>Li Huowang had no intentions of saying anything. They continued walking for about a quarter hour, arriving in front of an tall black pill furnace that appeared ancient.</p><br>
    <p>The furnace that was emmiting a green smoke reached the cave ceiling, appearing like a metal mountain.</p><br>
    <p>Walking towards the furnace, the shadow of the furnace finally completely covered him, making Li Huowang feel depressed.</p><br>
    <p>What made him so depressed was not only the enourmas five-layer pill furnace, but also the figure standing next to it.</p><br>
    <p>From the back, he looked like an immortal, with a blue-green daoist robe, a harpin and crown, and white hair on his temples.</p><br>
    <p>Sitting cross-legged on the ground, he seemed to be doing the same thing as Li Huowang - smashing a pestle down over and over again - just that the pestle in his hand was much bigger, appearing like an enourmous pillar.</p><br>
    <p>The sound of gold stones being crushed continuously reverberated in the cave.</p><br>
    <p> "Mas... Master!"</p>
    <p> The slant-mouthed woman clumsily pinched her left thumb with her right hard, and covered her right fingers with her four left ones, bringing them to her chest, greeting the back of the figure with eyes full of respect.</p><br>
    <p>As she spoke, the harsh sound of crushing stopped.</p><br>
    <p>Although Li Huowang was prepared for it, he still felt shocked when the figure turned around.</p><br>
    <p>The Daoist priest's front was completely different from his back - from the back, he appeared like an immortal, but from the back, he had a head of old dishevelled hair, a few yellowed teeth hanging from his gaping mouth.</p><br>
    <p> "Arrived? Good disciple, I've been waiting."</p>
    <p> Waving his dirty robe, the old Daoist priest rose and grabbed the crooked-mouthed woman by the neck, and turned back.</p><br>
    <p>Without wating for the retarded woman to speak even half a sentance, he threw her into a jar half as tall as a man. The next instant, the master, his face full of ferocity, smashed a stone rod the size of a fist down with both hands.</p><br>
    <p>As the cracking of bones rang out, the woman's head was immediately crushed into a sheet, and white brain matter spurted out from her orfices.</p><br>
    <p>Not yet finished, the stone rod was raised high again, and, smashing down heavily, every part of the woman's body met the same fate as her head.</p><br>
    <p>With each thud, the flesh and skin on Li Huowang's stony face shook violently.</p><br>
    <p>As blood and crushed flesh splashed onto the old Daoist priest's face and body, he remained unmoved. Instead, he fervently chanted something to a tune.</p><br>
    <p> "Ding Chou prolongs my life, Ding Hai guards my soul, Jia Zi guards my body, Jia Xu protects my form, Jia Shen strengthens my fate, Jia Wu shields my soul, Jia Chen is my true spirit!"<sup><a id="ref-2" href="#note-2">[2]</a></sup></p><br>
    <p>After pounding his disciple into mush, he used one hand to pick up the several hundred catty stone jar, pouring the contents into the pill furnace in front of him. Immediately after, his expression twisted with exitement as he thrust both hands into the air.</p><br>
    <p> "Start the furnace, refine the pills!"</p><br>
    <p>Two Daoist youths with exaggerated blushes came out from the shadows, fanning the fire while throwing all kinds of materials into the furnace, including gold stone powder and various still wriggling living things.</p><br>
    <p>In a short while, a kind of strange aroma wafted through the air - not the aroma of other things, but the aroma of human flesh.</p><br>
    <p>At this moment, the mangy master closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, touching his beardless chin, his dirty, twisted face revealing a look of satisfaction.</p><br>
    <p>As he languidly opened his eyes, he tucked his hands behind his back and slowly turned towards Li Chuowang.</p>
    <p> "I heard you called this Old Daoist a fart? Is that a thing?"</p><br>
    <p>The surroundings seemed to instantly freeze.</p><br>
    <p>Looking at the murderous "master" in front of him, Li Huowang stood still, slowly closing his eyes to calm his chaotic breathing, thinking to himself in his heart: "You can't fool me, this is all fake, all fake."</p><br>
    <p> "Speak! Are you Mute? En?!"</p>
    <p> As the sound of his master's footsteps approached, the disgusting, fishy smell of blood hit his nose like a wall.</p><br>
    <p>The trembling Li Huowang fiercely clenched his teeth together, using all his strength to open his eyes.</p><br>
    <p>What was just a dark cave dojo was instantly replaced with a bright and clean hospital ward, its air fresh and clean. The lower half of his body was secured tightly to the bed beneath him with straps of cloth.</p><br>

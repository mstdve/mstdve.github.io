    <h1>15 · The Legendary Inspector</h1>
    <p>Morning.</p><br>
    <p>With the gentle sound of rain in his ears, millions of raindrops, silver and threadlike, set up the main theme for the day.</p><br>
    <p>Shen Yi opened his eyes, feeling refreshed.</p><br>
    <p>Having slept well the previous night, he had absolutely no nightmares and didn't notice anything abnormal happenning.</p><br>
    <p> "Although much has happenned, the only thing worth celebrating is that the cafe is still peaceful."</p><br>
    <p>Shen Yi had always felt safe within the cafe.</p><br>
    <p>He got out of bed, washed, brushed his teeth, and tidied up his appearance, and began preparing for a day's work.</p><br>
    <p>After turning on the coffee machine, drinking fountain, and refregerator lights, he wiped down the tables, chairs, and bar counter, as well as the flooring, making sure it was spotless.</p><br>
    <p>Checking the tableware for damage, making sure the flowers in the vases are fresh... He finished up doing what he needed to do before opening.</p><br>
    <p>Shen Yi sat behind the bar counter, turned on some soothing music, and waited for customers.</p><br>
    <p>He folded his hands and sincerely prayed: "I hope there won't any strange people today."</p><br>
    <hr class="content">
    <br>
    <p>Outside the cafe, the drizzling rain continuously struck the black-colored umbrella.</p><br>
    <p>Beneath the umbrella was an expressionless, middle-aged man his early forties.</p><br>
    <p>He wore a large black trech coat, and a shocking scar at the corner of his mouth. His face was unkempt, and he gave off somewhat of a disheveled air.</p><br>
    <p>Those who didn't know him could never have imagined that this lazy-seeming man was one the seven A-grade inspectors in Nolan.</p><br>
